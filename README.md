# Advent of Code 2020

A Programming Language Per Day

| Day | Language     | Notes                                                               |
|:---:|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | x86 Assembly | Uses a recursive backtracking algorithm capable of any number count |
| 2   | OCaml        | Uses no additional storage -- O(1) space -- but reads file twice    |
| 3   | Awk          | Single pass through file, counting all tree collisions              |
| 4   | Perl         | Regular expression all the things                                   |
| 5   | Bash         | Only uses bash + coreutils (tr and echo are the only external cmds) |
| 6   | Python       | Kakes use of generators and extensive list comprehensions           |
| 7   | Julia        | Regex + comprehension for input. Sets for determining composition   |
| 8   | Lua          | Translated from a javascript solution. My first lua program!        |
| 9   | F#           | (Ab)using sequences for fun(ctional programming) and profit         |
| 10  | Haskell      | Converted my OCaml solution to Haskell                              |
| 11  | C            | Total of two dynamic memory allocations -- size is not hardcoded.   |
| 12  | Swift        | Combination of Functional, Object-oriented, and fun with enums      |
| 13  | Rust         | "Sliding bus" solver for part 2 rather than CRT                     |
| 14  | Ruby         | Standard object-oriented Ruby                                       |
| 15  | PHP          | Uses a closure to simplify implementation                           |
| 16  | Lisp         | Brute force implementation using core Common Lisp                   |
| 17  | C++          | Fully generic multidimensional code with hash sets for frontier     |
| 18  | Flex + Bison | Building your own compiler counts as a language, right?             |
| 19  | Kotlin       | Non-deterministic Push-down automata simulator!                     |
| 20  | JavaScript*  | Detect locations of tiles, then construct, then search*             |
| 21  | R            | Creates a new environment for the potential allergens + ingredients |
| 22  | TypeScript   | Converted Javascript -> Typescript                                  |
| 23  | Scala        | No linked lists -- only arrays and fun in scala!                    |
| 24  |              |                                                                     |
| 25  |              |                                                                     |
